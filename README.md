## Hi there, I'm Abdullah Bera ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist and photographer. I grew up in three different cities around the world. I love traveling without an itinerary, getting lost, and exploring serendipitously.

<!-- **AbdullahBera/AbdullahBera** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building AI agents to assist restaurant managers with operations and decision-making.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about ML foundations and AI agent development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: During my sophomore year of college, I backpacked across Europe for 30 days with just $500â€”sleeping on the streets or crashing at strangers' places along the way.

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:abdullahberakucuk@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
